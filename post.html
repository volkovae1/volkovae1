                        <p>In 15 weeks of labs and mastery assignments, I have matured from being an incapable little GIS baby into a slightly less incapable GIS
                        toddler. Here's a summary of my progression:</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Baby's First Steps</h2>
                        <p>The first task of the semester was to identify and map neighborhoods containing Philadelphia School District schools that both enroll more than 1,200 students and are also within 0.1 mile of the bike network.
                        This was a relevant and simple exercise to introduce fields, attributes, filtering, and sorting. We were also introduced to the <i>wonderful</i> world of layouts inside ArcGIS Pro. While not the prettiest, this map gets the job done by drawing the eye to the areas of interest.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Layout1.jpg.png" alt="..." /></a>
                        <h3><i>Skills I used for this problem:</i></h3>
                        <p>&#x2022; Using Attribute SQL queries—I used this for selecting schools that enrolled more than 1,200 students</p>
                        <p>&#x2022; Spatial Selection—I used this for selecting schools within 0.1 mile of the bike network and neighborhoods that contained previously selected schools</p>
                        <p>&#x2022;Creating a new map layer from a selection of features—I used this to create a map of the 5 schools and 4 neighborhoods</p>
                        <p>&#x2022; Working in Layout view—I used this for arranging and exporting aforementioned map</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Shapes and Colors</h2>
                        <p>In October we graduated to graduated symbology, which allowed us to create area-class, dot density, and choropleth maps (or heat maps). These types of maps display data symbolically, and are good for data communication for most audiences (in my opinion).</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Layout2.png" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>The task for this lab report was to map the spatial distribution of the Hispanic population in the contiguous U.S. by state, according to the 2010 U.S. Census. Since the real differences between percentages is so small, I ventured a little bit into programming and labelled each state with its percentage. Looking back, I could have added a white halo around the percentages to make them more visible.</p>
                        <h3><i>Skills I used for this problem:</i></h3>
                        <p>&#x2022; Changing layer symbology to create area-class, proportional, dot, and choropleth maps—I used these to create deliverables showing the spatial distribution of the Hispanic population in the US</p>
                        <p>&#x2022; Labelling—I used this to label US states for the map deliverables</p>
                        <p>&#x2022; Working with ungrouped graphic objects—I used this to manipulate the legend in map layouts</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>
                        <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Layout.png" alt="..." /></a>

                        <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>
                        <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>
                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                        <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
