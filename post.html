                        <p>In 15 weeks of labs and mastery assignments, I have matured from being an incapable little GIS baby into a slightly less incapable GIS
                        toddler. Here's a summary of my progression:</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Baby's First Steps</h2>
                        <p>The first task of the semester was to identify and map neighborhoods containing Philadelphia School District schools that both enroll more than 1,200 students and are also within 0.1 mile of the bike network. Makes sense--accessible, well-funded schools are important.</p>
                        <p>This was a relevant and simple exercise to introduce fields, layers, and selections. We were also introduced to the <i>wonderful</i> world of layouts inside ArcGIS Pro. While not the prettiest, this map gets the job done by drawing the eye to the areas of interest.</p>
                        <a><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Layout1.png" alt="..." /></a>
                        <h3><i>Skills I used for this problem:</i></h3>
                        <p>&#x2022; Using Attribute SQL queries—I used this for selecting schools that enrolled more than 1,200 students</p>
                        <p>&#x2022; Spatial Selection—I used this for selecting schools within 0.1 mile of the bike network and neighborhoods that contained previously selected schools</p>
                        <p>&#x2022;Creating a new map layer from a selection of features—I used this to create a map of the 5 schools and 4 neighborhoods</p>
                        <p>&#x2022; Working in Layout view—I used this for arranging and exporting aforementioned map</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Shapes and Colors</h2>
                        <p>In October we graduated to graduated symbology, which allowed us to create area-class, dot density, and choropleth maps (or heat maps). These types of maps display data symbolically, and are good for data communication for most audiences.</p>
                        <a><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Layout2.png" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>The task for this lab report was to map the spatial distribution of the Hispanic population in the contiguous U.S. by state, according to the 2010 U.S. Census. Since the real differences between percentages is so small, I ventured a little bit into programming and labelled each state with its percentage. Looking back, I could have added a white halo around the percentages to make them more visible.</p>
                        <h3><i>Skills I used for this problem:</i></h3>
                        <p>&#x2022; Changing layer symbology to create area-class, proportional, dot, and choropleth maps—I used these to create deliverables showing the spatial distribution of the Hispanic population in the US</p>
                        <p>&#x2022; Labelling—I used this to label US states for the map deliverables</p>
                        <p>&#x2022; Working with ungrouped graphic objects—I used this to manipulate the legend in map layouts</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">New ways to select areas!</h2>
                        <a><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Layout.png" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>Our last lab report asked us to address an issue that hits a little too close to home as a public health student: food deserts. The task was to select an area for a new healthy food store in Philadelphia. The site had to be within an area targeted for investment, accessible by public transit, and not nearby current farmer's markets or corner stores participating in the Healthy Corner Store Initiative.
                        Meeting requirements for the site meant we had to learn about unions and intersections and multipart vs. singlepart layers. Since there were a handful of requirements and I didn't know a faster way to meet them, the process was somewhat ugly at points:</p>
                        <a><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Screenshot 2023-12-03 204233.png" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>But selecting areas based on their relationships to other layers is definitely an important skill to have. In regards to the lab question, since a larger contiguous area is desirable for securing a property for the store, the best area for establishing a new store would be the one selected in the finished map around Cecil B. Moore, Girard, and Fairmount stations. It has the largest area at 4,048,552 square feet.</p>
                        <h3><i>Skills I used for this problem:</i></h3>
                        <p>&#x2022; Buffering—used to create shapes indicating distance from a given point such as a subway station</p>
                        <p>&#x2022; Erasing—used to remove areas from consideration that didn’t meet site selection criteria</p>
                        <p>&#x2022; Union and intersect—used to create layers containing shapes from several other layers</p>
                        <p>&#x2022; Multipart and singlepart layers—converted a layer from multipart to singlepart so that each shape would have its own record in the attribute table</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Onwards and upwards</h2>
                        <p>So those were a few examples from the Fall 2023 semester of Fundamentals of GIS. While there is much more to learn, I'm glad I at least won't
                        have to walk into my job or internship and learn the interface on my own. Plus, coordinate systems are important and I probably never would have
                        used them properly if I didn't take this class. I am currently in a lab group that focuses on environmental health exposures, and so to have this foundation
                        in GIS--not only ArcGIS Pro, but the basic concepts of data manipulation and communication--is really wonderful. Happy travels to my classmates and I hope to have more GIS adventures in the future.</p>
